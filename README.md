# PCB-LEAF-INVERTER-POWERSTAGE
The Leaf Inverter Powerstage project is a modification to the ‘adapter board’ designed by Johannes Hubener for the Nissan Leaf Gen 2 Inverter, as part of the open inverter project (click the following link to learn more about that https://files.slack.com/files-pri/TSX6XE5P0-F01Q62M6L3F/image.png) .

Primarily, it involves switching out the proprietary Nissan wiring harness connector, with a readily available  TE Connectivity 776163-1. This reduces the barrier of adoption for the adapter board, as the user is no longer required to find a Leaf to salvage the proprietary connector. The board is being designed as a first step into custom EV components.
